        "1.  **Images as Data**: We learned that images are simply 3D NumPy arrays (Height, Width, Channels) and can be manipulated mathematically.\n",
        "2.  **Preprocessing**: We explored how to modify pixel values and reshape 2D images into 1D vectors for dense layers.\n",
        "3.  **Encoding**: We implemented One-Hot Encoding to convert categorical text labels into machine-readable vectors.\n",
        "4.  **Modeling**: We built a `Sequential` model with `Dense` layers, using `relu` for hidden layers and `softmax` for the output.\n",
        "5.  **Training**: We compiled the model with `categorical_crossentropy` and trained it using `model.fit()`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps**:\n",
        "*   Experiment with more layers or neurons to see if accuracy improves.\n",
        "*   Try using `Conv2D` layers (Convolutional layers) instead of just `Dense` layers to better capture spatial hierarchies in images.\n",
        "*   Apply these techniques to the full Fashion-MNIST dataset available in `tensorflow.keras.datasets`.\n"
