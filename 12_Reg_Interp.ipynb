        "As networks get deeper, they become harder to train due to vanishing gradients.\n",
        "*   **Concept:** Residual networks introduce \"skip connections\" (or identity shortcuts).\n",
        "*   **Mechanism:** The input $x$ is added to the output of a weight layer: $\\mathcal{F}(x) + x$.\n",
