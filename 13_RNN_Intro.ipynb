        "1.  **Text Data is Sequential**: Unlike images, text has a temporal dimension where order matters.\n",
        "2.  **RNNs are Specialized**: They maintain a hidden state (memory) to process sequences, making them ideal for NLP.\n",
        "3.  **Preprocessing is Vital**: Raw text must be tokenized, indexed, and padded before entering a network.\n",
        "4.  **Keras Simplifies Deep Learning**: With just a few lines of code, we can build complex architectures like Embeddings + LSTMs to perform sentiment analysis with high accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Next Steps:**\n",
        "*   Experiment with **Bidirectional LSTMs** to capture context from both directions.\n",
        "*   Try **Text Generation** by changing the output to a Softmax over the vocabulary size.\n",
        "*   Explore **Transformers** (like BERT or GPT), which have largely superseded RNNs for complex tasks, though RNNs remain a foundational concept.\n"
